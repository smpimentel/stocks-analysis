# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to analize stock data from 2017 and 2018 from 12 different companies.
Steve's parents were interested in 'DQ' and steve wanted to know more historical data about the companies performance
in the stock market before recommending anything to his parents.

## Results

The data seemed to suggest that DQ is probably not the best option for Steve's parents. although it did really well in 2017 
it tanked in 2018 suggesting that it may be a very volatile stock. One thing to keep in mind though is that it seemed to follow
a similar reaction to the other stocks that we were looking at. This could mean that something happened in the market that we
are unaware of or that the group of stocks that we are looking at are in similar fields and they are reacting to the same events in their specific fields.
The only companys that has seemed to have a net positive growth is 'RUN' and "ENPH".
But RUN only had a return of 5.5% in 2017 and then a really good year in 2018 at 84%, while ENPH had a massive 2017 at 129.5% and 
a very positive 2018 at 81.9%.

## Summary

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

The only advantage to refactoring code is to make it more efficient.
The disadvantage is that it was more lines of code which is not a big deal on a small scale 
like this project but on a larger scale can be more time consuming.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

I think that in a smaller project like this it doesn't make that big of a difference because you are only saving fractions of a second of time.
with larger projects you have to compare the benefit to efficiency and the amount of effort it will take. if it saves you more time in the long run 
to write the faster code but takes longer to produce
